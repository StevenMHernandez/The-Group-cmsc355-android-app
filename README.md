# Snake GO

## Iteration 2 Summary

Added API server: https://github.com/StevenmHernandez/the-group-cmsc355-api-server

## Iteration 1 Summary

Implemented Google Maps and Location Services. Spawning "apples" working correctly. 
Snake has a drawn length. Implemented an option menu detailing score and option
to view highscore.

User Stories Completed:
Display Menu, Random food items, Green apples, Red apples, End a Game.

Troubles:
User stories were initially based on the user being able to "see" the map, snake,
etc. We found that testing for a view on the map was not able to be done. We were 
able to adjust some of the stories to test similar stories accordingly. 

User Stories Incomplete:
Lose points when user is inactive, View statistics, loading screen, Add friends, Authentication,
presented a map.
Many of these were out of the scope for this iteration. Some were untestable.
