    <string name="snakego_poetry">Snake Poetry for our fellow SnakeGoers&#8230;\n\nThe appearance of
        a snake can evoke intense feelings of terror. And rightly
        so considering a snakebite can be so deadly. But beyond this visceral response,
        the snake is a multifaceted symbol. A little investigating reveals rich histories of the
        snake showing up in literature, art, and mythologies from around the world. Some of the
        following descriptions are among the most prevalent meanings attributed to the snake,
        despite cultural inflections: \n\nrenewal, as snakes periodically shed their skin,
        spiritual and physical rebirth,
        resurrection, life, Mother Earth, pregnancy, primordial nature, the sea, good and evil,
        the sun and moon, power, knowledge, cunning, deceit, and death. Snakes are sometimes
        portrayed as guardians of treasure, esoteric knowledge, and the afterlife. They also
        connote venom, medicine, expanded consciousness, the elixir of life, and immortality.\n\nIn
        Greek mythology, Asclepius is a god of healing and medicine who carries a snake
        entwined staff. The rod of Asclepius as its often called can be found throughout the world
        on flags and emblems of distinguished medical institutions, such as the World Health
        Organization and the American Medical Association. Although their meanings overlap,
        this rod is sometimes confused with the Caduceus, a rod with wings and two snakes wrapped
        around it, carried by the Greek god Hermes. Two snakes coiled around each other, a tree,
        or a staff in this case, tends to signify the union of opposing forces, similar to the yin
        and the yang. \n\nSimilarly, the Ouroboros is a well-known example of snake iconography which
        depicts a snake eating its tail. This represents cyclic manifestation, re-absorption,
        wholeness, infinity, self-creative divinities, and the generative Earth.\n\nThe snake is
        broadly considered to be synonymous with the serpent. In some East Asian cultures, there\'s no
        distinction between snakes, serpents, and dragons. \n\nWith so many meanings attached to the
        snake, it\'s a difficult creature to pin down, figuratively. How does the snake fit into
        our lives? Why do we impart such significance to the snake, and why such cultural
        recurrence - in art, movies, and literature? \n\nOne element of the snake\'s appeal is arguably its
        difficulty in being pinned down. This snake mysticism comes at least in part from its skin
        shedding trait. The snake\'s impression of continual rejuvenation combined with the terror, awe, and
        mystery of a snakebite\'s lethal venom parallels life in many ways. And life is defined by its opposite,
        death. The paradox of life eating life, creating death (from the Ouroboros) &#8230;
        changing, evolving, self-generating&#8230; This is a conundrum for humanity that percolates
        out (and in) - beyond to infinity, residing in a timeless place, constituting an unnameable
        transcendence.  As such, the snake stays. \n\nSnakeGo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
